# polycheck

A short and sweet library to check whether a point is contained within an arbitrary polygon.  Created as an excuse to work with GPU/CUDA 
code, and because Shapely is too slow...

## Prerequisites

Cuda installed in /usr/local/cuda 
Python 3.6 or greater 
Cmake 3.6 or greater 

## To build 

```source install.bash``` 

Test it with 
```python3 test_poly.py```
